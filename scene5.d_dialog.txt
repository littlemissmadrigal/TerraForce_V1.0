(As the corridor curves off to the right, you realise you’re heading in the opposite direction to the/hangar and aren’t sure where you’re going. Everything seems much dimmer than it did earlier – the/lights have clearly been turned down for night settings. You keep thinking you can hear a distant/echo of the whistling, and then realise it’s the thrumming of the machine, but you press ahead/regardless.//The corridor bends sharply to the left, and suddenly you find yourself in a large-ceilinged room not/dissimilar to the hangar you were in earlier, but with no window. In the corner is a Blue, slightly/distressed and shivering. They don’t seem to have a whistle in their hand – but clearly they had/something to do with the strange sound and look incredibly perturbed)
(As the corridor curves off to the left, you recognise some of the route the peacock green guard took/you on earlier, though everything is much dimmer – the lights have clearly been turned down for/night settings. You’re not sure whether you’re walking in the right direction: the whistling seems to/have stopped, but it could be that whatever it is has gone too far ahead for you to hear.//As you turn another corner, you find yourself in the hangar you were in earlier, except everybody/who was working in here seems to have left for the night. In the corner is a Blue, slightly distressed/and shivering.

/(As the Blue notices you, their face is overcome with a look of horror and dread. You signal to them/that it’s OK, but they’re frozen to the spot, seemingly terrified./
/As you begin to approach, they start to jibber in a high-pitched wail in what sounds like an old/Europian language, looking visibly more and more distressed. You move closer, and they move into/the corner slightly, while you continue to reassure them that it’s OK.
/Suddenly, as you get within arm’s length, they swing at you, punching you clean in the head and/push you against the wall. They begin to attack you, and you have no choice but to defend yourself...)
/(The Blue stumbles backwards, clearly heavily bruised and bleeding slightly. You take the chance to/escape out the exit you came in. As you are sprinting out of the hangar, you notice you guard you saw earlier/come walking in.)//Guard: I’ll take it from here, @. I’ll tackle that Blue scum...//(You have no idea why the guard was so annoyed by the/Blue, but you don’t want to wait to find out - panicked, you sprint back to your pod and clean/yourself up as quickly and thoroughly as you can).
/(You stumble and fall to the ground, heavily bruised and bleeding slightly. The Blue stands over you,/still visibly terrified, and shaking. As you feel yourself passing out, you spot the guard you saw/earlier entering the hangar, hollering at the Blue).//Guard: You piece of Blue scum, what have you done?!//(As he runs towards you both, you pass out)
