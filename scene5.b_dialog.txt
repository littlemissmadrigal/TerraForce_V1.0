(As the corridor curves off to the right, you realise you’re heading in the opposite direction to the/hangar and aren’t sure where you’re going. Everything seems much dimmer than it did earlier – the/lights have clearly been turned down for night settings. You keep thinking you can hear a distant/echo of the whistling, and then realise it’s the thrumming of the machine, but you press ahead/regardless.//The corridor bends sharply to the left, and suddenly you find yourself in a large-ceilinged room not/dissimilar to the hangar you were in earlier, but with no window. In the corner is a Blue, slightly/distressed and shivering. They don’t seem to have a whistle in their hand – but clearly they had/something to do with the strange sound and look incredibly perturbed)
(As the corridor curves off to the left, you recognise some of the route the peacock green guard took/you on earlier, though everything is much dimmer – the lights have clearly been turned down for/night settings. You’re not sure whether you’re walking in the right direction: the whistling seems to/have stopped, but it could be that whatever it is has gone too far ahead for you to hear.//As you turn another corner, you find yourself in the hangar you were in earlier, except everybody/who was working in here seems to have left for the night. In the corner is a Blue, slightly distressed/and shivering. They don’t seem to have a whistle in their hand – but clearly they had something to/do with the strange sound and look incredibly perturbed).
/(The Blue stares you in the eyes and visibly calms down slightly. They begin to move towards you/looking reassured for some reason you can’t deduce, and mumble something desperately in a/language you can’t understand. Suddenly, you hear a loud crash behind you)
/Guard: What are you doing here? (The guard walks with purpose towards the Blue, who stares in/horror, backing away from the both of you and jibbering in what sounds something old and/Europian.)
/Guard: And you!//(The guard turns to stare at you angrily)I just can’t stand the arrogance of it. Given a relocation place, and this is how you repay the/Terra Nation Alliance, @?//(They continue backing the Blue into a wall, and spit at their feet.)//Guard: Scum. You’re scum, the lot of you.//(The guard swings and punches the Blue to the side of the head, who crumples like an empty/envelope, letting out a high-pitched wailed. As the guard begins to kick the Blue, curled on the floor,/you rush forwards and try to separate the two, until the guard turns and swings at your stomach./The adrenaline hits, and you prepare to stand your ground...)
/(The guard stumbles backwards, clearly heavily bruised and bleeding slightly. You realise suddenly/the severity of what you have done. You still have no idea why the guard was so annoyed by the/Blue, but you don’t want to wait to find out - panicked, you sprint back to your pod and clean/yourself up as quickly and thoroughly as you can).
/(You stumble and fall to the ground, heavily bruised and bleeding slightly. The guard stands over you)//Guard: This may hurt a bit, @. *chuckles* But on the plus side, you won’t remember it tomorrow...//(They stamp their boot down onto your neck, and you instantly pass out).
/(You stumble and fall to the ground, heavily bruised and bleeding slightly. The guard stands over you)//Guard: Filthy vay-gan with your stupid gold bracelet. *chuckles* This may hurt a bit, @...//(They stamp their boot down onto your neck, and you instantly pass out).
