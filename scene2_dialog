(As you walk out into the hangar, you realise how breathtakingly vast the ship is: the room is so/cavernous and expansive that you can barely see the ceiling. There is a huge glass window on the/opposing wall, through which Earth, its moon, and Mars are visible. The glass tingles with the/rear-lights of by-passing ships. In the rafters above you, little metallic otheroids chirp and flitter/around, entirely unfazed by the hum of machinery around them.
/The guard turns to you with an emotionless, but not unfriendly, expression)//Guard: So, this is the main hangar. You will be stationed off in the living quarters, which is where I'm/taking you now. Your name is @, right?~
/Guard: Good, I thought so. It helps to learn as many names as possible on your first few days. The/population on this ship is currently at about 15,000, about 50% of which are humanoids, and we/haven't yet reached full capacity, so... well, you get the idea.
/Guard: I'm pretty sure that's your name? Sedative must still be wearing off. It does rather knock it/out of you. Don't worry, you should be fine once you get something to eat.
/(They nod in greeting at another passing guard as you walk out of the large main archway, and reach/a junction of several lower-ceilinged passageways. The walls look similar to the room you were just/in, polished and gleaming even in the mellower light of the corridor. You spot a small/humanoid in the distance, who appears to be dragging a large, seemingly heavy trolley)
/Guard: Don’t worry, they’re stronger than they look.
/(They notice your puzzled and concerned expression, as if you're looking for an elaboration)
/Guard: They're the Blues, they’re staff. Ships don't run on unicorns and dreams, you know... I'm/staff too, of course, but I'm  a Green, so I’m qualified to interact with guests. The Blues, nope. Most/have English skills under the Terra Nation mandated Level 4. We’ve equipped them with standard/issue translators, but they obviously don’t come with any of the nuances of... well, of anything,/really. You can get their names, and give basic instructions, but trying to have a meaningful/conversation is like asking a toddler to do algebra.
/(They chuckle at their own joke, seemingly unaware that you’re feeling uncomfortable with the/conversation)
/Guard: It’s just better for everyone if they’re left to their own devices. They’re good at their jobs,/and well-looked after - plus, they’re up here and not on Earth. They’re lucky to be here, frankly. Now,/let’s get you to your quarters and get you fed. I’m assuming you’re comfortable with any synth/otheroid foodstuffs?/
1. Sure thing. I’m an all-eater.
2. Happy to eat otheroid plant-matter, synth or bio, but no animal-matter, please.
3. About as comfortable as I am with the blatant child slaves on the ship...
/Guard: Fantastic. No need for a dietary requirement bracelet in that case.
/Guard: Oh wow, old-fashioned! Not a problem, we’ll keep it to plant-synths. Let me just get you a/bracelet... //(They reach into their pocket and put a thin gold-coloured bracelet, entwined with tiny holographic leaves.)//Guard: That’ll do it. Show or scan that any time you need food and we’ll make sure it’s... ‘vay-gan’? Is/that the term?
/(Their expression doesn’t falter in the slightest)//Guard: (sarcastically) Well it seems the sedative is certainly wearing off at last...
/(They press something on their wrist display, before turning away from you and walk purposefully/as the corridor slopes off to the right. You begin to notice doors with ascending numbers: 5194,/5195...)
/Guard: Et voila, to use an archaic Spanish phrase. Room 5196, your pod. No need for keys, you can/access it via bioscanner: we took your bioprints etc. already while you were still sedated, so just/approach the door and it will open. Breakfast will arrive in your pod at 6:30 TNT (Terra Nation Time,/of course), and your induction & safety information will be in your podcast cloud. Dinner should be/already in there. Nice to meet you, @.
/(As they turn and walk off, you realise that the guard didn’t even give you their name, but you/suppose you’ll recognise them if you see them again. Still feeling slightly groggy, you look forward/and the door to your pod slides open)
