(As the corridor curves off to the right, you realise you’re heading in the opposite direction to the/hangar and aren’t sure where you’re going. Everything seems much dimmer than it did earlier – the/lights have clearly been turned down for night settings. You keep thinking you can hear a distant/echo of the whistling, and then realise it’s the thrumming of the machine, but you press ahead/regardless.//The corridor bends sharply to the left, and suddenly you find yourself in a large-ceilinged room not/dissimilar to the hangar you were in earlier, but with no window. In the corner is a Blue, slightly/distressed and shivering. They don’t seem to have a whistle in their hand – but clearly they had/something to do with the strange sound and look incredibly perturbed)
(As the corridor curves off to the left, you recognise some of the route the peacock green guard took/you on earlier, though everything is much dimmer – the lights have clearly been turned down for/night settings. You’re not sure whether you’re walking in the right direction: the whistling seems to/have stopped, but it could be that whatever it is has gone too far ahead for you to hear.//As you turn another corner, you find yourself in the hangar you were in earlier, except everybody/who was working in here seems to have left for the night. In the corner is a Blue, slightly distressed/and shivering. They don’t seem to have a whistle in their hand – but clearly they had something to/do with the strange sound and look incredibly perturbed).
/(The Blue stares you in the eyes and visibly calms down slightly. They begin to move towards you/looking reassured for some reason you can’t deduce, and mumble something desperately in a/language you can’t understand. Suddenly, you hear a loud crash behind you)
/Guard: I *knew* you were going to be trouble. I just bloody knew it. I knew it wasn’t the sedative./Jamm swore you’d calm down once the sedative wore off, but I knew it was insolence! I told them!/12 hours on this ship and you’re already scraping its underbelly.//(The Blue stares in horror, backing away from the both of you and jibbering in what sounds like an/old Europian language, as the guard swaggers towards you, crunching their fist slightly)
/Guard: I just can’t stand the arrogance of it. You’re selected to be relocated, and this is how you/repay the Terra Nation Alliance, @? Somebody ought to teach you a lesson... //(The guard steps forward, takes a swing, and punches you to the side of the head. The world spins/slightly, and then your adrenaline kicks in and you prepare to stand your ground...)
/(The guard stumbles backwards, clearly heavily bruised and bleeding slightly. You realise suddenly/the severity of what you have done. You still have no idea why the guard was so annoyed by the/Blue, but you don’t want to wait to find out - panicked, you sprint back to your pod and clean/yourself up as quickly and thoroughly as you can).
/(You stumble and fall to the ground, heavily bruised and bleeding slightly. The guard stands over you)//Guard: This may hurt a bit, @. *chuckles* But on the plus side, you won’t remember it tomorrow...//(They stamp their boot down onto your neck, and you instantly pass out).
/(You stumble and fall to the ground, heavily bruised and bleeding slightly. The guard stands over you)//Guard: Filthy ‘vaygan’ with your stupid gold bracelet. *chuckles* This may hurt a bit, @...//(They stamp their boot down onto your neck, and you instantly pass out).
