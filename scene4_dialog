(You wake suddenly to hear a disturbing whistling sound coming from the corridor. It sounds painful/and desperate, and you can’t work out what on earth the noise is. You bolt upright, listening as it/seems to get further away, and gets drowned by the thrum of the ship.
/You get up as quickly as you can, grabbing your things from the bedside table, and head out of the/door. You can’t tell if the sound has gone right or left – the ship is humming too loudly. You’re going/to have to guess, it seems.)
[Which way would you like to turn? (R/L)]
/(You follow the sound off to the right, concerned at what you might find...)
/(You follow the sound off to the left, concerned at what you might find...)
