(As you walk into your pod, the comforting smell of bio-wood hits your nostrils, and you notice/they’ve bought all of your bedroom furniture: the polished lightwood & chrome Charlottine desk,/the antique Ikea bed, and your velvet throw, a deep tanzanite-coloured banner draped across your/duvet. The wall panels are the standard Earth model you find in budget hotels or dorm rooms, where/they’ve set the colour-setting to ‘light glow’ so that the room seems larger than it is without the/need for natural light.
/You notice a small ensuite to your right, which seems to have a run-of-the-mill ablutions station/and mirror, and a small wardrobe inset into the wall opposite. On the desk is a cloche, clearly/with your evening meal inside, and some assorted trinkets you can only assume they took from your/mantelpiece.)
1. Eat dinner
2. Investigate the trinkets
3. Look in the wardrobe
4. Go to sleep
/(You open to cloche to find a large portion of synth meat. The veins look even more metallic blue/than they do on earth, but you suppose that given the oxygen supply up here is cleaner, it makes/sense. Next to it is a small pot of New London-style sauce (with that traditional terrifyingly yellow/hue everyone speculates is from some ancient English mustard powder, but nobody ever seems to/really know or care since it’s so delicious), and a wildflower and dandelion salad. You hungrily wolf it/down, using the annoyingly blunt silicone knife and fork they’ve provided you with. It tastes good,/and leaves you so full you can barely move.)
/(You open the cloche to find a bamboo steamer. As you lift the lid of the steamer, the smell of/smoked tempeh hits your nostrils, and you see tiny hand-twisted dumplings – your favourite. In the/layer underneath, you find the traditional New London trappings of 3-pepper rice and mushy peas./You wolf it up as quickly as possible with the annoyingly blunt silicone knife and fork they’ve/provided you with. It tastes delicious, and fills you up.)
/(You approach the desk and notice your bifocals – nowhere near as fancy as the monocle Jamm had/on, but still pretty good and with all the standard mod-cons. They seem to be fully charged, which is/good. You also notice they’ve brought your antique cigarette lighter, shaped like a cowboy pistol/(you’d always found it hilarious, ever since you were a kid), and three packets of gum in your/favourite flavours: jujube, gooseberry, and the limited edition cinnamint you bought in bulk and/stored boxes of in your house. For the first time, homesickness hits you slightly, and decide to keep/one of the items in your pocket for comfort’s sake.)
1. Chewing gum
2. Bifocals
3. Cigarette lighter
/(You pick up the chewing gum, pop a piece in your mouth (mmm... gooseberry) and decide to put it/on the bedside table – you can pick it up in the morning before you go out.)
/(You pick up the bifocals, give them a quick polish, and decide to put them on the bedside table/– you can pick them up in the morning before you go out.)
/(You pick up the cigarette lighter, click it to check it’s still working (it is, and it makes you giggle as ever),/and decide to put it on the bedside table – you can pick it up in the morning before you go out.)
/(You open the wardrobe and find a selection of everyday wear, a couple of formalwear items and/some exercise clothes. In the corner, folded up, you spot your favourite comfy clothes, with their/bright peacock-blue fabric and beautiful hand-stitching, and @ engraved on the lapel).//[Would you like to put them on?] ~
/(You slip into your comfy clothes - so comfy, and such a gorgeous blue. You wish you could wear/these everyday)
/(You decide to save those for a day when you need a pick-me-up - after all, you're a bit sweaty and/smelly from the unplanned journey)
/(You walk over to the bed, pull back the covers, and slip inside – the bedding feels just as soft and/inviting as it did on Earth, and you’ve never been more pleased to be in your own sheets in your life./You set an alarm on your wrist band, lean back into the pillow, and before you’ve even had a chance/to take off your shoes, fall sound asleep almost instantly...)
