/(You wake groggily in the metallic-walled chamber of what appears to be a spacecraft, sitting in a/comfortable, antique-style office swivel chair. A humanoid with a monocle, which flickers/occasionally with small electronic veins, is looking at you with an earnest expression)
/Humanoid: No need to be alarmed. The sedative can cause mild anxiety, but it should subside in a/few minutes. Now, I need to cross-reference with our records. Can you please confirm your first/name for me?
/Humanoid: Brilliant, thank you for confirming: that all seems to match our records. Now, I/understand you may be confused. Would you like me to explain what you are doing here?~
/Humanoid: Very well, @. I assume you know what is going on, in that case. Let me acquaint you/with where you are.
/Humanoid: Of course. You may want to take a seat, @.
/(They pause and re-adjust their monocle, the plexiglass shimmering in the lights of their display/screen)
/Humanoid: Now, as I am sure you are aware, Earth and the Terra Nations have been running into some.../difficulties with resources as of late. Short of extreme terraforming, the planet is likely to become/almost entirely uninhabitable in the next 20 years. I'm sure you've seen the news? And the/alternative proposals and so on and so forth...?~
/Humanoid: It's rather irrelevant, really. Simply put, the only solution that will reliably work is to/terraform. And to terraform a populated planet would be like trying to wallpaper a bouncy castle./Even with private ships and the Terra Nations Alliance fleets combined, we cannot house the entire/humanoid and otheroid population of the planet. As it stands, we can hit about a 10% life- archive/rate. If we're lucky, we'll perhaps manage an extra 1-2% with extra fleet production by the end of/the year. Do you follow? I assume you can see where this is going?~
/(They stare with a calm, well-practised assurance.)//Humanoid: I know, it's a lot to take in at all once. It has been tough to make these decisions.
/(They stare with a calm, well-practised assurance.)//Humanoid: It is difficult. The decisions have been tough.
/The good news is that you have been selected for the Earth Relocation Progamme. This is/Ship X-AE13.29 in the Gineos Fleet, where you will reside until the terraforming is complete. Your/pod has been fitted with objects from your home deemed suitable for interstellar transportation/without customs clearance. As I'm sure you can imagine, to alert the general population of what is/going on would cause mass panic, and would rob us of the chance to save earth life moving/forwards. As a result, you categorically cannot make any contact from this point on with any/humanoids or otheroids not aboard this craft, even on other ships within the fleet.
/Now, do you have any questions for me?/
1. *slurs* No, I need time to p--pr--proshessh... process. You know what I mean.
2. Yes. Why me?
3. Sure I do. How in the hell can you sit there so calmly and condemn 90% of the human race to death?
/Humanoid: Very well, I suspected as much. I assure you the sedative will wear off soon, but perhaps/something to eat would help.
/Humanoid: Partially luck, and partially selection. We have had to semi-randomise the selection/process, otherwise how on earth we could pick between two identical existences in accordance with/our metrics is beyond me. But it is fair to say that we have been narrowing the pool somewhat,/selecting those who will have the best skillsets to help us rebuild post-terraform.
/(They look extremely taken aback)//Humanoid: Composure and lack of feeling should be conflated, @. I am calm because I have had/time to become accustomed to the fact, and because I appreciate that, simply put, we have no/choice. It is a question of whether to save 10% of Earth's population, or none of it. And frankly, I/doubt anyone would choose to condemn everyone for the sake of all being in the same boat, to use/an archaic expression.
/Now, I think we should get you to your pod. If you have any further questions, please feel free to/ask for me: my name is Jamm, Onboard Assistant #b-222, and I or my colleagues will be available to/answer any further questions you have whenever the need arises. All the best with settling in, @.
/(You hear a clunky, metallic door slide behind you and swivel round in your chair. The chamber has/opened into what looks like a hangar, and a humanoid guard in a peacock green, vinyl uniform is/waiting at the door. You hear Jamm rustling behind you, clearly uninterested now their job in/inducting you is finished. Slowly, you stand, feeling your legs wobble slightly, and proceed through/the door out into the hangar)
